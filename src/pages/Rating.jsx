        <p>Amazing movie. Loved every bits and pieces of the movie. The camera work, editing, music - they all have given each other a very tough run.

Gripping, gets you hooked to your seat. The whole team delivered a masterclass. Not the usual commercial masala. Way better than that. I worry why the Tamil actors haven't attempted this sort of one previously and who else better to do than Ajith Kumar. It could have been Yohan:Adhyayam Ondru for Vijay.

Loved the stunts. The acting from everyone was just enough and badass.

Anirudh ain't no human - the guy teleported us to a Hollywood movie for real.

Vidaamuyarchi - solid winner, a blockbuster.</p>
